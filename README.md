# Scout-Plan-Build

**Structured AI development workflows that actually ship.**

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but chaotic. Without structure, you get:
- Sprawling conversations that lose context
- No clear separation between planning and building
- Files dumped in random locations
- No way to resume after a break

**Scout-Plan-Build** enforces a workflow: discover relevant files, create a spec, then build from that spec. Every step is traceable, every output has a canonical location.

---

## Quick Start

### Natural Language Approach (Recommended)

Just describe what you want in plain English - the framework handles the rest:

```
You: "Add OAuth2 login to the authentication system"

Claude automatically:
1. Scouts for relevant auth files
2. Creates a detailed specification
3. Implements the feature
4. Runs tests and validates
```

See [Natural Language Guide](docs/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md) for examples and patterns.

### Command-Driven Approach

For more control, use explicit commands:

```bash
# Find files relevant to your task
Grep "authentication" --type py

# Create a specification
/plan_w_docs_improved "Add OAuth2 login" "" "scout_outputs/relevant_files.json"

# Build from the spec
/workflow:build_adw "specs/issue-001-oauth2.md"
```

That's the core loop: **Scout → Plan → Build**.

## When to Use What

```
What's your task?
│
├─ Simple (1-2 files, obvious fix)
│   └─ Just do it. No framework needed.
│
├─ Standard (3-5 files, clear requirements)
│   └─ /plan_w_docs_improved → /workflow:build_adw
│
├─ Complex (6+ files, new feature)
│   └─ Scout first → /plan_w_docs_improved → /workflow:build_adw
│
├─ Uncertain (multiple valid approaches)
│   └─ /git:init-parallel-worktrees → try each → /git:merge-worktree best one
│
└─ Research (exploring unknown codebase)
    └─ Task(Explore) or Grep/Glob directly
```

## 🚀 High-Leverage Skills

**Operationalized tools that provide 100x leverage through automation.**

> **Philosophy**: Instead of manually tracing dependencies across 100 files (2 hours), run a single command (5 seconds). Instead of downloading and analyzing videos manually (30 minutes each), automate the entire pipeline. High-leverage tools turn repetitive expert work into deterministic scripts.

### How Tools Work Together

```
dependency-tracer → Identifies broken imports (95% token savings)
        ↓
Coach Mode → Shows transparent analysis process (~15% overhead)
        ↓
/plan_w_docs_improved → Creates fix specification
        ↓
/workflow:build_adw → Implements fixes automatically
```

### dependency-tracer: Token-Efficient Dependency Analysis

Trace Python imports and file references with **95% token savings** using intelligent summary modes:

```bash
# Trace all dependencies (100 tokens instead of 50K+)
CONTEXT_MODE=minimal bash scripts/dependency-tracer/scripts/trace_all.sh

# Generate ASCII dependency diagrams
python scripts/dependency-tracer/scripts/generate_ascii_diagrams.py \
  scout_outputs/traces/latest/python_imports.json

# View results
cat scout_outputs/traces/latest/summary.md
```

**Visual Output Example:**
```
Total Imports: 324
├─ ✓ Valid: 316 (97%)
└─ ✗ Broken: 8 (2%)

├─ ✓ adw_build.py (13 imports, 0 broken)
│  ├─ ✓ sys [import] (installed)
│  └─ ✓ adw_modules.state [from] (local)
└─ ✗ adw_fix.py (8 imports, 1 broken)
   └─ ✗ **missing_module** [from] (BROKEN)
```

**Key Features:**
- Environment-aware (Claude Code CLI, Claude Web, terminal)
- Fix-conversation optimized (spawn targeted agents per broken import)
- Non-invasive defaults (respects existing project structure)
- Zero MCP overhead (native CLI tools only)

### video-ops: Multi-Platform Video Download & Processing

Download videos and audio from 1000+ platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) with quality selection, caption extraction, and playlist support:

```bash
# Download video
/video-download https://youtube.com/watch?v=...

# Audio-only extraction
/video-download --audio-only https://...

# Batch download with filtering
/video-download --playlist https://... --filter "tutorial"
```

## 🎓 Coach Mode

**Learn as Claude works.** Coach Mode makes AI decision-making transparent:

```bash
/coach          # Toggle coaching on/off (balanced ~15% overhead)
/coach minimal  # Symbols only (~5% overhead)
/coach full     # Maximum transparency (~30% overhead)
```

**What You'll See:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📍 Journey: Implement OAuth2                    │
│ [▶ Scout] → [Plan] → [Build] → [Test]          │
│ 🎯 Goal: Add OAuth2 login flow                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

🤔 Decision: Which auth library?
   → Choosing: next-auth (matches your stack)

⚙️ Using: Grep → Found 3 auth files
📊 Progress: 2/4 complete

## Installation

```bash
./scripts/install_to_new_repo.sh /path/to/your/repo
cd /path/to/your/repo
cp .env.template .env  # Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Your existing code is untouched. The framework installs alongside it.

## Why This Works

**Parallel Execution**: Test, review, and document phases run simultaneously.
- Sequential: 12-17 minutes
- Parallel: 8-11 minutes (40-50% faster)

**Token Efficiency**: Smart tools minimize context consumption.
- Traditional: 60,000 tokens for dependency analysis
- dependency-tracer: 3,100 tokens (95% reduction)

**Session Continuity**: Handoff documents capture context. Resume with `/session:resume` after any break.

**Canonical Locations**: Every output has a home. Specs go in `specs/`, reports in `ai_docs/build_reports/`, scout results in `scout_outputs/`.

**Natural Language First**: Just describe your intent - the framework routes to the right tools and commands automatically. See [Natural Language Guide](docs/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md).

**Validated Through Use**: This framework was built using itself. Every feature was spec'd, built, and refined through the ADW workflow.

---

## Example Workflows

### Adding a Feature

**Natural Language (Simple):**
```
You: "Add 2FA support to the login flow"
→ Claude handles Scout → Plan → Build automatically
```

**Command-Driven (Control):**
```bash
# 1. Scout for relevant code
Grep "user_auth" --type py
# Found: auth.py, middleware.py, routes.py

# 2. Create specification
/plan_w_docs_improved "Add 2FA support to login flow" "" "scout_outputs/relevant_files.json"
# Creates: specs/issue-001-2fa-support.md

# 3. Build from spec
/workflow:build_adw "specs/issue-001-2fa-support.md"
# Implements, tests, documents
```

### Trying Multiple Approaches

```bash
# 1. Create parallel worktrees
/git:init-parallel-worktrees cache-strategy 3

# 2. Each worktree tries a different approach
# tree-1: Redis caching
# tree-2: In-memory LRU
# tree-3: SQLite cache

# 3. Compare results
/git:compare-worktrees cache-strategy

# 4. Merge the winner
/git:merge-worktree trees/cache-strategy-2
```

### Resuming After a Break

```bash
# Before leaving
/session:prepare-compaction

# After returning (even in new session)
/session:resume
# Reads handoff, restores context, asks what's next
```

### Analyzing Dependencies

```bash
# Trace all dependencies with minimal context (95% token savings)
CONTEXT_MODE=minimal bash scripts/dependency-tracer/scripts/trace_all.sh

# Generate visual ASCII diagrams
python scripts/dependency-tracer/scripts/generate_ascii_diagrams.py \
  scout_outputs/traces/latest/python_imports.json summary

# View broken imports summary
cat scout_outputs/traces/latest/summary.md

# Spawn fix agents for each broken import
python scripts/dependency-tracer/scripts/adw_spawn_fix_agents.py \
  scout_outputs/traces/latest/python_imports.json
```

**Result:** Instead of loading 50K+ tokens of dependency data, you get:
- 100 tokens for main summary
- 300 tokens per fix-conversation (only for broken imports)
- Visual ASCII diagrams for pattern recognition

## Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Natural Language | ✅ Working | Primary interface (see [guide](docs/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md)) |
| Scout (file discovery) | ⚠️ Use native | Grep/Glob work better than `/scout` commands |
| Plan (spec generation) | ✅ Working | `/plan_w_docs_improved` functional |
| Build (implementation) | ✅ Working | `/workflow:build_adw` functional |
| Parallel execution | ✅ Working | 40-50% speedup confirmed |
| Session continuity | ✅ Working | `/session:resume` functional |
| Coach Mode | ✅ Working | Transparent workflows with 3 levels |
| dependency-tracer | ✅ Working | 95% token reduction, ASCII diagrams |
| Portability | 🟡 85% | Some paths hardcoded, improving |

> **Note**: The `/scout` slash commands are partially broken. Use native Grep/Glob tools for file discovery instead. Natural language interface is the recommended starting point for all tasks.
