## Framework Insights

1. **ai_docs/ write patterns now documented**: Only build_reports/ and sessions/ have deterministic writes. Everything else is manual session dumps.

2. **feedback/ is future infrastructure**: The predictions/outcomes/corrections folders are scaffolding for V2 Feedback Loop (Agentic Primitives V2, Section 8).

3. **Command naming convention**: Use colon notation (`/git:commit`) to match directory structure.

4. **ADW workflow validated**: Used successfully for documentation cleanup and consolidation.

## Quick Resume Commands

```bash
# Check state
git log --oneline -5
git status

# See what's documented as pending
cat specs/todo-documentation-improvements.md

# Resume with
/session:resume
```
