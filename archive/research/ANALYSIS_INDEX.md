## Key Findings Summary

### Existing Assets
- 2 skills implemented (both MVP-level)
- 37 Python files with production-quality code
- 9+ exception types with recovery strategies
- Strong state management and validation layer

### Critical Issues
1. **No Determinism** - Skills produce different results on same input
2. **Scout Phase Broken** - External tools missing, unreliable
3. **Memory Underutilized** - Infrastructure exists, not being used
4. **No Testing Framework** - Can't verify quality or determinism

### High-Leverage Opportunities
1. **Validation Skill** (95% ready) - 9/10 leverage
2. **Git Operations Skill** (90% ready) - 8/10 leverage
3. **State Manager Skill** (95% ready) - 7/10 leverage
4. **Memory Integration** (60% ready) - 7/10 leverage, 30% speedup
5. **Deterministic Scout** (40% ready) - 6/10 leverage, critical fix

### Effort & Value
- Total Effort: 130 hours / 8 weeks part-time
- Expected Value: 2-3x performance improvement + production-ready reliability
