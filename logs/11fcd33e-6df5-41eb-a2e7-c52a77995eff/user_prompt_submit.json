I want to implement git work tree parallelization, both for github and bitbucket into this framework. before we do that... i have an analysis of indydevdan's parallell git worktree strategy video. for resources like this that we'll use to build out our framework, where would you suggest we store them? what makes sense? and how should we stay organized? somewhere in the ai_docs folder? somewhere else so it's obvious they're external resources not related to the repo? what's best practice? think hard about this, and lmk what you think before we do anything... it's an md file that i generated from a YT video transcript with ascii graphs. ty!"
