What are the different routes to take? how can we simplify the UX so that the user is always aware of these routes to take? and can it be done in a way where we're not wasting tokens? where it's almost like a router or deterministic? think hard about this. my goal is to make this framework robust and clear and simple to use, with as many of the adws, agentic eng. primitives, and clear usage paths as portable and usable and well documented as possible. we have 17% ctxt remaining, so i want to have a clear idea of where to go next, and all the info we've uncovered and things worked on so we can continue after compaction seamlessly using this framework to build out any and all of those action items, to make this framework usable for other repos i have cooking. think hard, and lmk how i can help!"
