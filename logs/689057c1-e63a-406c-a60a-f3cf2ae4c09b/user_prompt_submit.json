    "prompt": "this is what claude is suggesting based on your specs_alignment_review.... do u think it's overengineering? be brutally honest and objective... we're going for something that's MVP but has the scaffold to be built into production level eventually. think hard about this. lmk if you have Qs. tysm!\n\n  The alignment review is excellent but I see 7 critical opportunities to make it even stronger. Let me identify them and then launch specialized\n  agents to implement improvements.\n\n  \u2605 Insight \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  The review correctly identifies Scout determinism as the foundation, but misses that determinism alone isn't enough - we need observable,\n  versioned, and consensus-validated determinism with performance guarantees. This transforms Scout from \"just works\" to \"provably works with\n  measurable confidence\".\n  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n  Opportunities for Enhancement\n\n  1. Scout Result Fingerprinting \ud83d\udd0d\n  - Add cryptographic hashing of scout results for validation\n  - Enable cache invalidation based on fingerprint changes\n  - Track scout result evolution over time\n\n  2. Skill Composition Patterns \ud83d\udd17\n  - Skills aren't independent - they should compose\n  - skill-002 should validate skill-000 outputs\n  - skill-003 should checkpoint skill-000 results\n  - skill-005 should handle skill-000 failures\n\n  3. Property-Based Testing \ud83e\uddea\n  - Beyond \"same input \u2192 same output\"\n  - Test invariants: \"scout never returns duplicates\"\n  - Test properties: \"fallback level N+1 \u2286 level N\"\n\n  4. Cross-Platform Determinism \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\n  - Mac/Linux/WSL determinism guarantees\n  - Handle filesystem case sensitivity differences\n  - Path separator normalization\n\n  5. Performance SLAs \u23f1\ufe0f\n  - Scout must complete in <30s for 95th percentile\n  - Memory usage must stay under 500MB\n  - Define degradation thresholds per level\n\n  6. Observability Strategy \ud83d\udcca\n  - Structured logging with correlation IDs\n  - Metrics collection (scout success rate, fallback distribution)\n  - Distributed tracing for Scout\u2192Plan\u2192Build\n\n  7. Production Rollout Safety \ud83d\ude80\n  - A/B testing framework\n  - Canary deployments\n  - Automatic rollback on failure"

    "prompt": "great! we've implemented your suggested changes. Now... did we ever address the root level repo .md files? and fix them so they're alligned with what this repo is actually for? (a meta development tool/agentic layer for Catsy to use around their java codebase?). we had some incorrect stuff about how this would be a product itself... it's not. We want to re-allign and make this presentable as an MVP that catsy can start using for some low hanging fruit development processes... we're at 78% context used, so if it makes sense, launch one or several haiku 4.5 subagents to assess these docs and where we're at... and then you (main agent) can assess the analysis doc (i think one would be best? if possible?) and propose/make changes to make to the docs to make this more presentable, as well as reorginzation into folders if appropriate... we want to make this presentable an digestible, and not overwhelming... practical to use with examples. think hard about this plz. lmk how i can help! and lmk where you save everything, and how this is determined (like by what logic/rules). tysm!"
