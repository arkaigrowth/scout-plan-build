NOTE: plz carefully consider this new research in \"~/AI/scout_plan_build_mvp/ai_docs/research/implementations/slash-commands-chaining-chad.md\". this is how we want to contruct non-brittle composable slash commands. we want to leverage slash commands as invokable by the LLM, but have strict rules about how this works to prevent issues, which that doc details. steelman the approach and review critically using claude code agentic engineering sota best practices.\n\nthink ULTRA HARD about this. and propose the approaches we can take to untangle and discover the path forward. so grateful for u! lmk how i can help.

I do want to use Opus for the reasoning and checking of work, but we could spawn sonnet subagents to review the report and plan work? Plz suggest how you think we should approach it within our framework, and whether we should use parallel subagents on our worktrees? think hard, and lmk what you think before we begin. this may be a considerable overhaul, and some parts may be incompatible w/ what we have built or vice versa, so we have to be extra careful, thorough, fastidious, and precise. be brutally honest about what is appropriate and what will work, any maintenance overhead. we want as low friction and sensible as possible, but we also want robust security and organization. tough balance i realize lol. tysm! take a deep breath and think hard! lmk how i can help. but first let's figure out how we want to tackle the implementation of these new features/techniques and what it'll entail. lmk what u think!"
