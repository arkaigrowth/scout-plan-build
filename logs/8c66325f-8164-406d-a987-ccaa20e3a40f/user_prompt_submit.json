I think the menu idea is not a bad one.. unless you have other ideas that could be better? is this best practice? remember we're shooting \nfor as much determinism and non brittleness as possible\n\n3. we don't know... may need to test and assess these with the parallel worktrees approach or scout subagents? plz consider how we can find out\n\nnote: the '/sc:' commands are all from another framework called superclaude. do u think these will conflict? or should we keep them? NOTE: plz carefully consider this new research in \"~/AI/scout_plan_build_mvp/ai_docs/research/implementations/slash-commands-chaining-chad.md\". this is how we want to contruct non-brittle composable slash commands. we want to leverage slash commands as invokable by the LLM, but have strict rules about how this works to prevent issues, which that doc details. steelman the approach and review critically using claude code agentic engineering sota best practices.\n\nthink ULTRA HARD about this. and propose the approaches we can take to untangle and discover the path forward. so grateful for u! lmk how i can help. You're doing Great! "

The testing agents should probably be sonnet 4.5. any lower level doc stuff could be haiku 4.5 agents. and then big picture stuff and supervision/review stick to opus (that's you right now). plz explain all the framework parts in action as you're using/testing them so we can later review and understand what's going on and what's working/not. think hard and tysm!"

I propose a diff format in the document that i mention below. don't wanna make it too long... should also still sort easily... let's use best practice, which i believe my doc below does.  we don't want to make it unfriendly for the user... also are those subagent report paths hardcoded?  I feel like we have so many paths for things... wanna make sure they're not all mixed up... for example we have scout outputs folder and we also have a ai_docs/scout folder... i don't fully understand the diff and when each is used...\n\nbased on indydevdan's agentic engineering course, i've added @ai_docs/research/implementations/agent-box-supervisor-chad.md which is a detailed document that goes into how we can make this framework more robust.. consider how we will approach this with our 42% remaining context efficiently and maximum impact. I do want to use Opus for the reasoning and checking of work, but we could spawn sonnet subagents to review the report and plan work? Plz suggest how you think we should approach it within our framework, and whether we should use parallel subagents on our worktrees? think hard, and lmk what you think before we begin. this may be a considerable overhaul, and some parts may be incompatible w/ what we have built or vice versa, so we have to be extra careful, thorough, fastidious, and precise. be brutally honest about what is appropriate and what will work, any maintenance overhead. we want as low friction and sensible as possible, but we also want robust security and organization. tough balance i realize lol. tysm! take a deep breath and think hard! lmk how i can help. but first let's figure out how we want to tackle the implementation of these new features/techniques and what it'll entail. lmk what u think!"
