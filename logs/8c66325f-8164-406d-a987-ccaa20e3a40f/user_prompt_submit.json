I think the menu idea is not a bad one.. unless you have other ideas that could be better? is this best practice? remember we're shooting \nfor as much determinism and non brittleness as possible\n\n3. we don't know... may need to test and assess these with the parallel worktrees approach or scout subagents? plz consider how we can find out\n\nnote: the '/sc:' commands are all from another framework called superclaude. do u think these will conflict? or should we keep them? NOTE: plz carefully consider this new research in \"~/AI/scout_plan_build_mvp/ai_docs/research/implementations/slash-commands-chaining-chad.md\". this is how we want to contruct non-brittle composable slash commands. we want to leverage slash commands as invokable by the LLM, but have strict rules about how this works to prevent issues, which that doc details. steelman the approach and review critically using claude code agentic engineering sota best practices.\n\nthink ULTRA HARD about this. and propose the approaches we can take to untangle and discover the path forward. so grateful for u! lmk how i can help. You're doing Great! "

The testing agents should probably be sonnet 4.5. any lower level doc stuff could be haiku 4.5 agents. and then big picture stuff and supervision/review stick to opus (that's you right now). plz explain all the framework parts in action as you're using/testing them so we can later review and understand what's going on and what's working/not. think hard and tysm!"
