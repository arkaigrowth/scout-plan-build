Test with Real Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)\n    - Create actual GitHub issue\n    - Run: uv run adws/adw_sdlc.py <issue> <adw-id> --parallel\n    - Measure actual speedup\n  2. Framework Portability Issues (MUST FIX for Catsy)\n    - Decouple from GitHub (add local mode)\n    - Flexible ID formats (not just ADW-XXXXX)\n    - Better env var handling\n    - Mock/test mode for development\n  3. Create Architecture Diagrams (NEXT SESSION FOCUS)\n    - Overall Scout\u2192Plan\u2192Build flow diagram\n    - Parallel execution sequence diagram\n    - Component interaction UML\n    - State management flow\n\n  \ud83d\udcca Next Session: Architecture Diagrams Needed\n\n  After compaction, create these critical diagrams:\n\n  1. System Architecture Overview\n    - Three-layer architecture (UI/Orchestration/Infrastructure)\n    - Show parallel vs sequential flow paths\n  2. Parallel Execution Sequence Diagram\n    - Plan \u2192 Build \u2192 [Test||Review||Document] \u2192 Commit\n    - Show subprocess.Popen() parallelization\n  3. Component Interaction UML\n    - ADW modules relationships\n    - State management flow\n    - Git operations coordination\n  4. Scout\u2192Plan\u2192Build Pipeline\n    - Task agents exploration\n    - Spec generation\n    - Implementation flow\n\n  \ud83d\udea8 Don't Forget These Insights\n\n  1. Simple > Complex: 30 lines beat 150+ lines when delivering same value\n  2. Git Conflict Solution: --no-commit flags + single aggregated commit\n  3. Framework Limitations Found: GitHub coupling, strict ID format, env issues\n  4. User Feedback Matters: \"Are we overengineering?\" saved 10+ hours\n\n  \ud83c\udfac Quick Demo Commands\n\n  # Show it works (after compaction)\n  git checkout feature/simple-parallel-execution\n\n  # Compare timing\n  time uv run adws/adw_sdlc.py 123 test-001          # Serial\n  time uv run adws/adw_sdlc.py 124 test-002 --parallel  # Parallel\n\n  # Expected: 40-50% speedup\n\n  \ud83d\udccd Branch Status\n\n  - Current Branch: feature/simple-parallel-execution\n  - Commits: 2 clean commits\n  - Ready: For testing and PR\n\n  CRITICAL: Framework successfully dogfooded itself - ultimate validation! The simple solution works and is documented. Focus next\n  session on visual architecture documentation to help new engineers understand the system.\n\nlet's start with the diagrams. I think some subagents to construct them woudl be appropriate. maybe in parallel? Sonnet subagents? wdyt? Think hard, try to follow the framework, lmk if you have any Qs! or spot anything awry that needs fixing. appreciate u!"

'i stand on the shoulders of giants' big thanks to indydevdan for the knowledge and principles. check him out at tacticalengineering.com' or something...? is it portable yet? do we have too many readmes? should we launch scouts to assess, then you examine with opus? wdyt? think hard... thanks! u got this! lmk how i can help"
