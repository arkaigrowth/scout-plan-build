If you can't do\n  inline w/o breaking, then do an explanation before or after..\n\n  then investigate apogee and windsurf with some sonnet subagents.. but for context i rarely use my apogee (and their software is not supported\n  anymore or something? idk need to dive deeper and search the web maybe... and create an ai_docs folder that that has subfolders for various\n  report subtypes based on best practices... don't need to populate now, just think ahead and in terms of surgical well organized system\n  monitoring, with an emphasis on LLMs. Write scout reports as artifacts to the\n#END DRAFT\n\nplz make this better and lmk if u have Qs\n"
