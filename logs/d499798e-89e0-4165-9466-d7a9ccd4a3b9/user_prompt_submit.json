    "prompt": "Hey claude. we want to get this framework into ship shape for portability, and make sure it's all organized, and we have clear understanding and instructions on how to use\n  it, with examples... slash commands, natural language, the whole nine.\n\n  right now i'm not sure that we're using the ADWs properly, nor the git worktree parallelization. We need some kind of... idk. hints? to keep users on track? or at least\n  examples of how to use it end to end? And that should include the git worktree parallelization, and how it can work with bitbucket (if at all).\n\n  think super hard plz... and use subagents where appropriate to explore and get lay of the land... we did some reorganization of the repo... if anything is not clear in the\n  claude.md, or is outdated, we will need to update that. we want this to work as frictionlessly as possible and have it read for the team to use.\n\n  another problem is that whenever we run scouts (like now for instance) we're dumping md files into the repo root, which doesn't seem like the corret organized approach...\n  also it can be hard to know what the created md files are from... like what task? or request? or even... what date? they don't have timestmaps... let's think hard about all\n  of the above, and consider the best approach of resolving these challenges, and getting everything ready for a presentation to share with the team, and allow them to hit the\n  ground running.  \n\nultimately, we want to understand how all the pieces fit together and work together and how to use them seamlesssly. If we already have docs about this, then we can reference them, but need to make sure they're up-to-date. because this has been a constantly changing piece of work. tysm! appreciate u!"

Why do we need an Anthropic API key as stated in step 0?\n\nalso, i thought that we were trying to lean heavily into the natural language usage? so for step 1 in the @docs/FRAMEWORK_USAGE_GUIDE.md... why are we forcing devs to type all that? shouldn't it be smart enough to handle natural language requests??\n\nalso not understanding the '/plan_w_docs' slash command... what if we don't have docs? and what does does it reference by default? do we have to specify? and if we do have docs, where should they be dropped?\n\nalso... explain when the '/build_adw' command should be used? I think we need a higher level big picture understanding of when to use what... with examples. and that includes the step 4 stuff. need to better understand what the adw_sdlc.py script does... and again, we don't want to force too many flags and stuff on them. we want natural language biased!\n\nand the other big shortcoming... we want this to be completely tailored for bitbucket usage, which is what the team uses. \n\nif we wanted to try usign the framework for the above... woudl it be appropriate? and how would we do so? think hard about all of the above.\n\nthink hard, use subagents where appropriate to preserve context, and lmk if you have any questions... i feel like i have this framework, but am not using it correctly... want to master the ADW use cases and patterns, and have them NL-biased. tysm!"
