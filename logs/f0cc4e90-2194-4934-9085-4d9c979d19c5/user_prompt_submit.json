We need to review and organize the root-level md files because they're a mess. we're at 72% context. plz review the work done by another agent below, modify as needed, and if once it looks good, run the @REORGANIZATION_SCRIPT.sh. then give me an overview that makes sense of this and makes it more approachable, digestible, and can serve as a guide. Launch subagents as needed to preserve our remaining context, but if you think you can tackle this all yourself, then go for it... think hard, u got this! tysm! lmk if you have Qs. review the plan and files below:\n\nBased on the subagent analysis showing 21 root .md files creating confusion, I've created a radical simplification that\n  consolidates everything into just 4 focused documents.\n\n  \u2605 Insight \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  The consolidation isn't just about reducing file count\u2014it's about changing the narrative. The subagents found 48 mentions of\n  \"product\" and \"monetization\" but ZERO mentions of Catsy or Java.

If it's research, planning, or\n  \"someday\" features, it goes to archive. This isn't deletion\u2014it's prioritization. The research is valuable, but it shouldn't block\n  people from using the tool.\n  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n  \u2705 Ready for Action\n\n  The reorganization is designed, documented, and scripted. Running REORGANIZATION_SCRIPT.sh will transform this from a confusing\n  research project into a practical tool Catsy's Java team can start using immediately.\n\n  Would you like me to execute the reorganization now, or would you prefer to review the new documents first?"
