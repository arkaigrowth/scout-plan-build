Basically i want a better understanding of how everything flows, slash commands,\n  hooks,... think hard about the best way to represent this... we could do ASCII diagrams, mermaid diagrams, and we want to make sure we\n  have detailed docs... i guess, why don't you review the docs that the haiku scouts and you created earlier? and compare the current state\n  of repo to those? and improve them and the claude.md to make sure everything is working properly...  and explain... for this particular request, what would be a good way to run it? plz advise. think hard. be cs tutor and senior code reviewer, documenter, educator. tysm! lmk how i can help"

I think we want to leverage that to be true ballers no?\n\nthink hard about these things, and how that would affect parallelization... think hard, and lmk how i can help. appreciate u! tysm. launch subagents as needed to accomplish the above plz"
